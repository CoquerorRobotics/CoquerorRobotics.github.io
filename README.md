VEX Pages

# This is a website that our group made it together. The website talks about every detail of our process while we are studying, designing, training, and practicing for the VEX competition in 2021. On the website, you will be able to find the process of our daily practice, the design of the robot, and everything about our team members. You may also see the hard works that we did. The website is all made by ourselves, without helps from adults. Have fun watching our website. Thanks!
